# Tree Traversals

Traversal is a process to visit all the nodes of a tree and may print their values too.

- All nodes are connected via edges (links), hence we always start from the root (head) node. That is, we cannot randomly access a node in a tree. There are three ways which we use to traverse a tree âˆ’
  - In-order Traversal
  - Pre-order Traversal
  - Post-order Traversal
- Generally, we traverse a tree to search or locate a given item or key in the tree or to
  print all the values it contains.

## Preoder Traversal

In this traversal method, the root node is
visited first, then the left subtree and
finally the right subtre

### Algorithm

1. Recursively traverse the left subtree.
2. Recursively visit the right subtree.
3. Visit the root nodes.

### Time Complexity

Time complexity of Preorder is O(n)

## Postorder Traversal

## Inorder Travesal
