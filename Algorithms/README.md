## Dijkstra's Algorithm

- Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.

### Time Complexity
 Time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm is O ( V 2 ) O(V^2) O(V2) where V is the number of verices in the graph.

## Floyd's Algorithm

- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest path between all the pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. This algorithm works for both the directed and undirected weighted graphs. But, it does not work for the graphs with negative cycles (where the sum of the edges in a cycle is negative).

- A weighted graph is a graph in which each edge has a numerical value associated with it.

- Floyd-Warhshall algorithm is also called as Floyd's algorithm, Roy-Floyd algorithm, Roy-Warshall algorithm, or WFI algorithm.

- This algorithm follows the dynamic programming approach to find the shortest paths.

### Time Complexity

There are three loops. Each loop has constant complexities. So, the time complexity of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is O(n3).
